# Trcacar Queue

## Basic deployment command

Execute only Linux, macOS, or Windows WSL, as there no promise volume mounting will work directly on windows, this environment is intended for a live development for traccar and is far from an actual production development from security and functionality view.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gpproton/microQueue.git && \
git checkout dev && \
cd microQueue && \
chmod +x ./composer.sh && ./composer.sh && \
composer.phar install  -d ./php-sample/ && \
docker-compose up -d && \
sleep 15 && \
tail -f ./data/traccar/logs/tracker-server.log
```

NOTE: NOTE: Extensive test have not been performed on the RabbitMQ integration, due to time i hope it works for you.

### Component of setup

- Traccar Instance - required for decoding TCP/UDP packet and push to PHP API.
- Apache Container - Receives raw JSON payload of positions and event from traccar and parse to RabbitMQ for it required purpose.
- RabbitMQ - For message queuing.

A quick view at the sample PHP api allows for posting raw JSON to `http://localhost:4567/?state-type=Publish` while receiving at `http://localhost:4567/?state-type=Consume` as a cron or background task simulation this purely a test again and not close to a proper implementation at least with the consumer part, but the producer module is clearly a direct explanation on using with traccar forwarder located at conf/traccar/traccar.xml with entry key forward.url
